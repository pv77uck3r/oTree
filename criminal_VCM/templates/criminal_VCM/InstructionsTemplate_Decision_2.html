        Instructions
    </h3>
    <p>
        As previously stated, you will have 10 quarters at your disposal. You can put them into your Private Account or you can
        put them into the Group Account. Each subject has two types of decisions in this experiment, which will be
        referred to as "unconditional contribution" and "contribution list".
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>
            <b>Unconditional contribution:</b>
            You will first decide how many of the 10 quarters you want to place into the Group Account.
        </p></li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Contribution list:</b> You will next decide to how to fill in a "contribution list" where you
                decide how many quarters you would like to contribute to the Group Account <strong>conditional</strong>
                on each possible contribution of the <strong>other</strong> group members.
            </p>
            <p>
                There will be several situations that describe the possible average contribution of the <strong>other</strong> group members
                to the Group Account. You simply have to select how many quarters you will contribute to the Group Account
                for each scenario. You must select a number everywhere you can. For example, you will have to
                indicate how much you will contribute if the other members of the group contribute an average of 0, 1, 2 quarters, etc.
                Again, you can select any whole number of quarters.
            </p>
            <p>
                After all participants in your group have made the above two sets of decisions, a random mechanism will
                select a single group member from every group. They will have their conditional contribution implemented
                and the rest of the group members will have their unconditional contributions implemented. You do not
                know whom will be selected in your group, so you must think carefully about both the conditional and
                unconditional contributions you will make.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Imagine that <strong>you are selected by the random mechanism</strong>. Imagine that the other two members of
        your group contribute an average of 10 quarters. The computer will then look in the contribution list for what you decided
        to contribute when the other members contributed and average of 10 quarters. Imagine you said you would contribute 4 quarters when the other
        members contributed an average of 10 quarters. Then the Group Account would have \( 2 \time 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ quarters} \). Since everyone gets a half quarter for every
        quarter in the Group Account, you would receive a 7 quarter return from the Group Account and a 6 quarter return from your
        Private Account (since 10 - 4 = 6), meaning, in total, you would have earned 13 quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now imagine <strong>you are not selected by the random mechanism</strong>. Assume your unconditional
        contribution to the Group Account is 6 quarters and the other unselected member of the group also contributed 6 quarters
        unconditionally. The computer will then look in the contribution list for what the selected group member decided
        to contribute when the other members contributed and average of 6 quarters. Imagine they contributed 8 quarters. Then the Group Account would
        total 6 + 6 + 8 = 20 quarters. Since everyone gets half of a quarter for every quarter in the Group Account, you would receive a
        10 quarter return from the Group Account and a 4 quarter from your Private Account (since 10 - 6 = 4), meaning, in
        total, you would have earned 14 quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
        The 2nd member of the group will always be the one that has their conditional contribution used in the payoff
        calculations. However, the computer <strong>randomly</strong> determines each members group ID number
        (1, 2, or 3) when forming the groups, and this number is never displayed to you or anyone else. Therefore the
        process for deciding whose conditional contribution will be used for determining payoffs is also random.
