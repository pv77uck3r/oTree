        In a previous set of experiments, real participants in the role of a prosecutor considered evidence of guilt
        coming from decisions about taking money in situations like the ones you faced.  Crimes those prosecutors
        observed were either a Small crime (taking money from another subject between $0.10 and $1.00), a Medium crime
        (between $1.00 and $2.00), or a Large crime (between $2.00 and $3.00). Those prosecutors made decisions about
        how to proceed when facing specific types of evidence they observe about a person (henceforth called a
        defendant).  For instance, a prosecutor could decide to drop the charge, they could decide to take the
        defendant to trial (in a computerized experimental trial in the lab today), or they could decide to make a plea
        bargain offer to the defendant.  We will match you randomly with the decisions of one of these prosecutor
        participants to determine how to proceed in today’s experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the prosecutor receives no evidence suggesting that you are guilty or the prosecutor decided not to pursue a
        charge against a defendant with the evidence of guilt that you have, then “the case is closed” and your
        decisions in this part of the experiment will not affect your pay.
    </p>
    <p>
        Depending upon the type of evidence the prosecutor receives regarding your innocence/guilt, the prosecutor may
        decide to offer you a plea bargain.  The prosecutor will not see your evidence of innocence (or lack thereof)
        when making their plea bargain decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        A plea bargain would involve you pleading guilty to a specific charge (or not contesting the charge) against
        you and would have a set monetary penalty associated with the guilty plea for that charge.
    </p>
    <p>
        A plea bargain offered by the prosecutor will also indicate to you what the prosecutor would charge you with at
        an experimental trial, an interval that the monetary penalty would come from if you were found guilty at the
        trial, and the evidence level they have of your guilt.  If you turn down the plea bargain then you and the
        prosecutor would take your case to trial.
    </p>
    <p>
        An experimental trial means taking the evidence of guilt for the charge the prosecutor is accusing you of and
        looking at the decisions of real participants who made decisions as jurors in previous experiments about these
        types of cases. The juror participants made decisions based upon different levels of evidence of innocence and
        guilt as to whether or not participants were guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt” with that level of evidence. An
        experimental trial consists of randomly drawing three of these past jurors’ decisions for the set of prosecutor
        and defense evidence presented in that case. If all three juror decisions are the same, then the unanimous
        decision determines whether the defendant is found guilty (if all three jurors chose “Guilty”) or not-guilty
        (if all three jurors chose “Not-Guilty”).  If all three jurors’ decisions are not the same, then the trial is
        called a “mistrial” and the computer will randomly select alternative sets of three jurors until the first time
        all three selected juror decisions match.
    </p>

    </h2>
    <p>
        As you can see in the table below, the actual guilt or innocence of a defendant determines both the
        prosecutorial and defense evidence.  On the prosecution side, if the defendant is truly guilty the prosecutor
        will receive some evidence of guilt 70% of the time. However, if the defendant is truly innocent the prosecutor
        will receive some evidence of guilt 30% of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the defense side, 80% of truly innocent defendants will receive some evidence of their own innocence, but
        20% will not. On the other hand, 30% of truly guilty defendants will receive some evidence of their own
        innocence, but 70% will not. The actual guilt or innocence status of a defendant is not known to the prosecutor
        or the jurors. You (the defendant) know for sure whether you are truly innocent or truly guilty.

    <p>
        A prosecutor will only bring a case to trial if there is evidence of guilt. If the prosecutor receives evidence
        of guilt (see table above), there are three possible levels of evidence: Strong, Medium, and Weak.  If the
        defendant receives evidence of innocence, there are three possible levels of evidence: Strong, Medium, and Weak.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the names suggest, Strong evidence is harder to get (and implies there is more evidence of guilt or
        innocence) than Medium evidence.  Medium evidence is harder to get (and implies there is more evidence of guilt
        or innocence) than Weak evidence.  For each of these three levels, a prosecutor is always more likely to get a
        particular level of evidence of guilt if the defendant is truly guilty compared to a truly innocent defendant.
        For each of these three levels, a truly innocent defendant is always more likely to get a particular level of
        evidence of innocence compared to a truly guilty defendant.

    <h2>
        <b>Plea Bargain Decisions </b>
    </h2>
    <p>
        We will ask you to go through the all the possible plea bargain offers that the prosecutor could offer you if
        they receive evidence suggesting your guilt.  If the prosecutor receives no evidence suggesting your guilt or
        the prosecutor declines to offer a plea bargain, these decisions will not affect your payments. If the
        prosecutor does receive evidence suggesting your guilt and offers you a plea bargain we will look at the
        relevant plea bargain response.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each computer screen will show you a specific possible plea bargain you could face for a given set of evidence
        of guilt and innocence and a particular crime and penalty offer to you.  After that penalty and crime are
        several possible trial threats that the prosecutor could make if you were to reject the plea bargain.  For each
        possible trial threat, please tell us whether, if the prosecutor assigned to you made that threat and
        associated plea bargain, you would prefer to a) take the plea bargain, b) go to trial and present your evidence
        of innocence, or c) go to trial but exercise your right to not testify on your own behalf.  Note: all jurors
        were instructed that:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        “A defendant has the option to make their evidence of innocence available or not.  This right to not “testify”
        is guaranteed by the United States Constitution and should not be taken as implying guilt.”
    </blockquote>
    {% comment %}<p>
       Your computer screen will be laid out as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
       At the top of the screen:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You will first see whether you are truly innocent or truly guilty of taking money from the participant for
            the decision you are being accused of taking money from the other participant.</li>
        <li>You will see your own evidence level of innocence (not observed by prosecutor). </li>
        <li>You will see the prosecutor’s level of evidence of guilt (would be presented at a trial).</li>
        <li>You will see the plea bargain offer, in other words what the punishment/monetary penalty would be for
            accepting the plea and what the charge associated with that plea bargain is.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Bottom portion of the screen:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You will then see a list of 1 to 5 possible trial threats for what you would face if you reject the plea
            offer indicated at the top of the screen. </li>
        <li>Each of these trial threats is a different possible choice that the prosecutor could have made. Treat
            these each as separate decisions.</li>
        <li>Indicate for each decision whether you would: a) take the plea bargain, b) go to trial and present your
            evidence of innocence, or c) go to trial but exercise your right to not testify on your own behalf.  </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For example, one screen might indicate that the relevant situation you are making decisions about is for when
        1) you are truly innocent;  2) your evidence of innocence is strong; 3) the prosecutor’s evidence of guilt is
        weak; 4) the plea bargain would be for you to plead guilty to a medium crime; and 5) pay a monetary fine of
        $1.00.  That screen would have two decisions for you to make.  First decision: Would you take the plea if
        rejecting the plea meant that you would go to trial for a large crime with a monetary penalty of between $1.10
        and $1.30 if you are found guilty at trial? You would choose to take the plea, go to trial with your evidence,
        or go to trial but choose not to present your evidence. Second decision: Would you take the plea if rejecting
        the plea meant that you would go to trial for a large crime with a monetary penalty of between $1.40 and $1.60
        if you are found guilty at trial? You would choose to take the plea, go to trial with your evidence, or go to
        trial but choose not to present your evidence. Remember each set of three choices represents a different
        possible plea bargain offer and trial threat and thus a different decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are many possible situations that you have to evaluate.  The computer will give you 30 seconds to make
        your selection on each page.  Each page contains 1 to 5 different plea bargains decisions.  If time expires,
        the computer will remind you to make your decisions quickly. Payoffs can only be calculated when the last
        participant has finished, which means that all participants must wait on the choices of the slowest participant
        before they may proceed to the next section of the experiment.
