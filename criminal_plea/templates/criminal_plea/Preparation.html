    <p>
        The computer will now provide you with the possible plea bargains that you might get if the prosecutor observes
        evidence that suggests you are guilty.
    </p>

    <p>
        These possible plea bargains are for the decision you made a few minutes ago where the computer randomly chose
        a preset division of $10 of $W for you and $10-W for your counterpart.
