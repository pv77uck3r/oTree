    <p>
        For the next set of decisions, you will select either "Accept" or "Reject" to indicate whether you would like to
        take the 50/50 gamble or not. One of the following 12 decisions will be chosen uniformly at random for payment.
        If you have chosen "Accept" for the randomly chosen decision, then the computer will randomly generate a number
        between 1 and 100. Each number is equally likely to be generated. If the number is less than 50, then the
        lower payoff will be selected for payment. If the number is greater than or equal to 50, then the higher payoff
        will be selected for payment. If you have chosen "Reject" then you will earn a payment of $0 for this decision.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the randomly selected decision is one of the decisions that involves "six independent repetitions of the
        gamble, and you selected "Accept" for that decision, the computer will randomly generate 6 numbers between 0 and
        100. The six randomly generated numbers will determine 6 payments in the manner described above, and these
        payments will be summed together for your your total payment for this elicitation.
    </p>

    <p>
        If this task is randomly selected for payment, you will also receive a bonus of $2.75 regardless of what your
        choice for this task is.
