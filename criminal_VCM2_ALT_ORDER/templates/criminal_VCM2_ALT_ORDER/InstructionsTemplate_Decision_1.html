        Instructions
    </h3>
    <p>
        As previously stated, you will have $10 at your disposal. You can put them into your Private Account or you can
        put them into the Group Account. Each subject has two types of decisions in this experiment, which will be
        referred to as "unconditional contribution" and "contribution list".
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>
            <b>Unconditional contribution:</b>
            You will first decide how many of the $10 you want to place into the Group Account.
        </p></li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Contribution list:</b> You will next decide to how to fill in a "contribution list" where you
                decide how many dollars you would like to contribute to the Group Account <strong>conditional</strong>
                on each possible contribution of the <strong>other</strong> group members.
            </p>
            <p>
                There will be hypothetical situations that describe the possible contributions of the <strong>other</strong> group members
                to the Group Account. You simply have to select how many dollars you will contribute to the Group Account
                for each hypothetical scenario. You must select a number everywhere you can. For example, you will have to
                indicate how much you will contribute if the other members of the group contribute 0, 2, 4 dollars, etc.
                Again, you can select any multiple of two dollars ($0, $2, $4, $6, $8, $10).
            </p>
            <p>
                After all participants in your group have made the above two sets of decisions, a random mechanism will
                select a single group member from every group. They will have their conditional contribution implemented
                and the rest of the group members will have their unconditional contributions implemented. You do not
                know whom will be selected in your group, so you must think carefully about both the conditional and
                unconditional contributions you will make.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Imagine that <strong>you are selected by the random mechanism</strong>. Imagine that the other two members of
        your group contribute a total of $10. The computer will then look in the contribution list for what you decided
        to contribute when the other members contributed $10. Imagine you said you would contribute $4 when the other
        members contributed $10. Then the Group Account would have $10 + $4 = $14. Since everyone gets $0.50 for every
        dollar in the Group Account, you would receive a $7 return from the Group Account and a $6 return from your
        Private Account (since $10 - $4 = $6), meaning, in total, you would have earned $13.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now imagine <strong>you are not selected by the random mechanism</strong>. Assume your unconditional
        contribution to the Group Account is $6 and the other unselected member of the group also contributed $6
        unconditionally. The computer will then look in the contribution list for what the selected group member decided
        to contribute when the other members contributed $12. Imagine they contributed $8. Then the Group Account would
        total $6 + $6 + $8 = $20. Since everyone gets $0.50 for every dollar in the Group Account, you would receive a
        $10 return from the Group Account and a $4 return from your Private Account (since $10 - $6 = $4), meaning, in
        total, you would have earned $14.
    </p>
    <p>
        The 2nd member of the group will always be the one that has their conditional contribution used in the payoff
        calculations. However, the computer <strong>randomly</strong> determines each members group ID number
        (1, 2, or 3) when forming the groups, and this number is never displayed to you or anyone else. Therefore the
        process for deciding whose conditional contribution will be used for determining payoffs is also random.
