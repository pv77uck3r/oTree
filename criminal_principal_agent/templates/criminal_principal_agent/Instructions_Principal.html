        Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another player. Each
        of you will be randomly assigned to be
        Participant A or Participant B. You will learn your role before making
        any decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participant A will propose a contract to B that has only one component:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fixed Payment</strong>, which can be any amount of points from 0 to
            120 and must be in increments of 10.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Once Participant A has submitted the contract, Participant B must
        decide whether to accept or to reject it. If rejected, A will receive
        nothing while B will receive {{ Constants.reject_agent_pay }}. If accepted, Participant B then
        chooses:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Effort Level</strong>, which can be any whole number from 1
            to 10
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Effort is costly only to Participant B and determines the total return,
        which will be apportioned according to the proposed return share. <i>The
        following table shows the relationship between B's effort, the cost of
        effort, and the resulting total return:</i>

        Given that the contract is accepted, Participant A will receive:<br/>
        $$ (120 - \text{fixed payment})* \frac{\text{B's effort}}{10}$$
        <br/>
        and Participant B will receive:<br/>
        $$ \text{fixed payment} - \text{cost of effort} - 20 $$
    </p>

    <p>
        For this part of the experiment, you will be randomly assigned a partner who could be one of several
        “types”.  In an interaction separate from their interaction with you the computer will randomly pair them with
        another participant. In that interaction, the computer will first divide $10 between your counterpart and this
        other participant.  Your counterpart will be given an opportunity (that they are not forced to accept) to take
        money that belongs to their partner. This could be any amount between $0.10 and $3.00.
    </p>

    <p>
        The decisions of other participants, in the role of a prosecutor and in the role of jurors, will determine
        whether those suspected of taking money from their partner are found guilty or not-guilty of having done so.
        Some truly innocent people may appear to be guilty and some truly guilty people may appear to be innocent. As a
        result, your possible counterparts are of different types: those found guilty of having taken a small amount of
        their partner’s money, those found guilty of having taken a medium amount, or those found guilty of having taken
        a large amount, those found not-guilty, and those never accused of such a theft. All participants found
        guilty of having taken money from another participant had to pay a monetary penalty as well.
