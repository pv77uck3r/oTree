    <p>
        Below is a list of statements which can be used to describe how people feel. Beside each statement are four
        options which indicate the degree with which each statement is self-descriptive of mood at this moment.
        Please read each statement carefully and select the option which best indicates how you feel right now, at this
        very moment, even if this is not how you usually feel.
    </p>
