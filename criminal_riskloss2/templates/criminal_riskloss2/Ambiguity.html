    <p>
    In the next set of decisions, we use digital boxes. In these digital boxes, there will always be 10 balls.
    These 10 balls can be either red or blue. In some boxes the proportion of red and blue balls are known, but in other
    boxes the proportion is unknown. The specifics of each box are discussed in more detail in the questions below. From
    each box, a single ball will be drawn.
    </p>

    <p>
        You must make two decisions for each box:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><p>
            Bet on the color of the drawn ball. If you correctly guess the color of the drawn ball, you will earn $2.50.
            If you do not correctly guess the color of the ball you will earn $0.00.
        </p></li>

        <li><p>
            Specify a price you would be willing be willing to sell your bet for. You can choose any amount between $0.00
            and $2.50. After you submit your price, the computer will randomly choose its own price between $0.00 and $2.50.
            Each price has an equal probability of being chosen by the computer. If your submitted price is lower than the
            price the computer chooses, you will be paid the price the computer has chosen. If your price is higher, your
            first decision will determine your earnings from the box.
        </p></li>
    </ol>
